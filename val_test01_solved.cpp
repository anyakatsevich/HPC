int main ( )

//****************************************************************************80
//
//  Purpose:
//
//    MAIN is the main program for TEST01.
//
//  Discussion:
//    
//    There were two errors: 
//    (1) in F an array of size n wad created using malloc,
//    but in the for loop, the first line attempts write to the (n+1)st location
//    and the second line attempts to read from the (n+1)st location, which was not//    allocated for. Valgrind gives the error messages "Invalid read/write of size
//    4", and also "Address 0x5a22068 is 0 bytes after a block of size 40 alloc'd" 
//    
//    (2) delete [] was used with malloc, (Valgrind gave error "Mismatched free() ///    delete / delete []"), which is wrong because delete [] assumes you created   //    the array with the new operator, which allocates the memory in a different 
//    place than malloc does. Free() should be used with malloc
//
//    TEST01 calls F, which has a memory "leak".  This memory leak can be
//    detected by VALGRID.
